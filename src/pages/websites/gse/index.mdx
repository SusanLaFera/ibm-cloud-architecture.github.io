### **Event Driven Reference Architecture**

[Event Driven Reference Architecture](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda/)
Event-driven architecture (EDA) is an architecture pattern 
that promotes the production, detection, consumption of, and 
reaction to events. This architectural pattern can be applied 
to the systems that transmit events among loosely coupled 
software components and services.
Some subsections of the site deal with particular elements of 
event driven architecture:
- [Event Storming Methodology](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda/methodology/readme/)
- [Event Storming Analysis](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc/analysis/readme/)
applied to the 
[Reefer Container Shipment](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc/)
reference application.
- [Process continuous streaming events for real time analytics](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda/rt-analytics/)

### **Cloud-Native 101 Bootcamp**

[Cloud-Native 101 Bootcamp](https://cloudnative101.dev) 
is a self-study course
