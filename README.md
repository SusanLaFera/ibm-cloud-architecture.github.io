### Publish Content

Currently, the content is published to the GitHub pages site through the `master` branch. The source content is in the `master-content` branch.
All of the details for handling the publishing are covered within
the deploy script. After running `npm install` on your local machine,
the deploy can be tested locally using the following:

```
npm run deploy
```

The process of contributing content to this site is fully described at
https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/contribute/.

The result of the `deploy` can be viewed here - https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/

**Note:** There is a time delay between when the deploy process completes and when the
content is available on the published site.
