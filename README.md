These assets range from blogs, webinars, videos, and courses to help you understand cloud concepts and IBM solutions to code and tools to ease your implementation.

```
git clone
```

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Publish Content

Currently, the content is published to the GitHub pages site through the `gh-pages` branch
using the `gh-pages` npm module. All of the details for handling the publishing are covered within
the deploy script. The deploy can be run using the following:

```
npm run deploy
```

The result of the `deploy` can be viewed here - https://pages.https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/

**Note:** There is a time delay between when the deploy process completes and when the
content is available on the published site.
