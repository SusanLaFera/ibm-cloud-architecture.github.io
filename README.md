## Activation kit

This site is a one stop shop for you to learn the foundations of IBM Garage delivery and IBM Garage Method. These assets range from blogs, webinars, videos, and courses to help you understand cloud concepts and IBM solutions to code and tools to ease your implementation.

The site is hosted at - [https://SusanLaFera/ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/)


```
git clone
```

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Publish Content

Currently, the content is published to the GitHub pages site through the `master` branch. The source content is in the `master-content` branch.
All of the details for handling the publishing are covered within
the deploy script. After running `npm install` on your local machine,
the deploy can be tested locally using the following:

```
npm run deploy
```

The process of contributing content to this site is fully described at
[https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/contribute/](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/contribute/).

The result of the `deploy` can be viewed here - [https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/).

**Note:** There is a time delay between when the deploy process completes and when the
content is available on the published site.
